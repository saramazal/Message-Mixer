# Message-Mixer

Message Mixer Inc. offers a message-encryption service that transforms input text, using various ciphers, 
and displays the encrypted message to the console.

## There are three encryption methods provided by this service:

   * A “Caesar Cipher” in which the characters of the input message are shifted alphabetically by a given amount.
   * A “Symbol Cipher” in which select characters from the input message are replaced with visually similar symbols.
   * A “Reverse Cipher” in which each word of the input message is reversed in place.
